Recent trends are doing online meeting by video conferencing. Movement from
one place to another place for meeting in short time are very serious problems for
business man, students, teachers, etc. So, I have created a platform for doing
online video conferencing by creating their own meeting room. So, all the seeker
who want to do online video conferencing with their friends can do in very easy
way.
